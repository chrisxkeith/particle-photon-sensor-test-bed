*See https://github.com/chrisxkeith/ir-qwiic-example (for infrared sensor) instead.*

To use on your Photon(s):
- Find the id(s) of your Photon(s) : https://community.particle.io/t/finding-your-device-id/26531
- Replace the id's in the '...id.equals(...' line(s) with your Photon id(s).
- Modify SensorData t1/t2/etc... to match your sensors.

Notes:
- Haven't tested on other types of Particle microcontrollers.
